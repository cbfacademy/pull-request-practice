## Task

1. Something they like

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository onto your machine
1. Create a branch and call it your name
1. Update the `index.html` with the [task instructions](#task)
1. Once you are happy with the changes add, commit and push to GitHub
1. On GitHub open a pull request
   1. Give your pull request a title and description
1. Request a review from someone in your study group
1. Once the reviewer has approved your pull request merge it into the `main` branch
