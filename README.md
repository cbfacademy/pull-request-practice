# 🤝 Pull Request Practice

## 🎯 Task

Each member of your study group needs to update the `index.html` to add:

1. Their name
1. Something they like

## 📋 Instructions

Before we get started, one person in your study group will need to fork this repository and then add the other members of the group as contributors. Don't worry if you've never done this before, we have provided a guide on [how to fork a repository](#forking-a-repository) and [how to add contributors](#adding-contributors) below.

Once you have your forked repository and your team is ready, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository onto your machine
1. Create a branch and call it your name
1. Update the `index.html` with the [task instructions](#task)
1. Once you are happy with the changes add, commit and push to GitHub
1. On GitHub open a pull request
   1. Give your pull request a title and description
1. Request a review from someone in your study group
1. Once the reviewer has approved your pull request merge it into the `main` branch

## 🍴 Forking a Repository

To fork this repository, simply follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to this repository on GitHub
1. Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the page
1. Wait for the repository to be copied to your account

You now have a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account! 🎉

## 👥 Adding Contributors

After forking the repository, you'll need to add your fellow group members as contributors. Here's how:

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub
1. Click on the "Settings" tab
1. Select "Manage Access" from the left sidebar
1. Click on "Invite a collaborator"
1. Enter your fellow group members' GitHub usernames and click "Add collaborator"

Your group members will then receive an email invitation to become contributors to your repository.
